I'm currently instructing a neuroscience course for high school students aged 16-17 at [Amir High School](https://amirschool.com/), focusing on the essentials and foundational concepts of _Systems Neuroscience_.

**Please note that the course is ongoing, and the files are not yet complete.**

You'll find the presentation slides for each session and some of their homework assignments below.
